Ubuntu docker images with ping and netcat

Just use the below command to create the image and start using Ubuntu with ping and netcat installed. I needed this while I was trying to understand more about Docker networking. 
Hope this helps.

> `docker build . -t ubuntu_ping_nc:latest`

Alternatively, you can also just run the build-image.sh

> `bash build-image.sh`
